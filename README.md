# Coord Exploit

Coordinate exploit found in late Febuary 2021 by Node3112, optimized and made more realistic to implement by NathanW.

Very simple process; Open a chest -> move into a chunk -> check if the chest has closed (signifying the chunk is loaded). Works generally like nocom as far as the concept goes.

Implementation for the tracker,scanner,etc will added in the coming weeks, for now it will mainly consist of basic client shit.
